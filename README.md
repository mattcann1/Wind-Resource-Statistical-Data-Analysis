# Statistical Data Analysis
## Introduction
Based on the data set (Met_Data_2016) which contains six months of wind measurement data collected in 1 min intervals, the following statistical data analysis was conducted. 

## Wind Data Characteristics
Average wind speed and standard deviation for all the data.
